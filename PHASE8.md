# Phase 8: Play Assistant — Requirements Document

## Overview

The Play Assistant is an interactive extension of the Number Assistant that enables users to receive number recommendations and directly confirm them for gameplay. This feature bridges the gap between AI analysis and actual game participation, creating a seamless experience from consultation to play.

## Core Feature Requirements

### Interactive Number Recommendations

**FR1: Visual Number Display**
- Assistant responses can display 6 numbers in a visual grid format
- Numbers should match the styling of the main number selection grid
- Each number appears as a clickable/selectable element

**FR2: Interactive Confirmation**
- Transparent confirmation button with timer-aware text below recommended number set
- Button text clearly indicates action: "Confirm Numbers" vs "Queue for Next Draw"
- Button behavior changes based on timer status while maintaining clear user expectations
- Visual feedback when user hovers/interacts with the confirmation option

**FR3: Natural Language Interface**
- Users interact through normal chat conversation
- No explicit UI controls for recommendation types
- Assistant interprets natural language requests:
  - "Show me hot numbers" → Hot number recommendations
  - "Give me cold numbers" → Cold number recommendations
  - "I need lucky numbers" → Balanced set recommendations
  - "What numbers should I pick?" → Best available recommendation

**FR4: Timer-Aware Functionality**
- Assistant automatically checks current timer state before displaying confirmation options
- Transparent button text clearly indicates what action will be taken:
  - OPEN: "Confirm Numbers" (immediate confirmation)
  - CUT_OFF/REVEAL/COMPLETE: "Queue for Next Draw" (queued for future)
- User always knows exactly what will happen when they click

**FR5: Smart Queuing System**
- When current draw is locked, automatically offer to queue numbers for next draw
- Show clear messaging: "This draw is locked. I'll queue these for the next draw."
- Persist queued selections across timer cycles
- Auto-apply queued numbers when new draw opens with notification

**FR6: Game State Integration**

**FR7: Number Selection Integration**
- Seamlessly integrate with existing NumberSelectionContext
- Replace any existing user selections with assistant recommendations
- Direct confirmation without additional user approval required

**FR8: Confirmation Flow Integration**
- Assistant confirmation immediately confirms numbers for the current draw
- Bypass manual selection grid and proceed directly to ticket confirmation
- Maintain existing credit deduction and game mechanics

**FR9: Enhanced Assistant Capabilities**

**FR10: Rich Content Responses**
- Assistant can render interactive UI components in chat
- Support for custom number grid components within chat interface
- Action buttons that trigger game state changes
- Real-time status updates based on game state

**FR11: Intelligent Recommendation Processing**
- Parse natural language to determine recommendation type using LLM system prompt
- CRITICAL: Numbers must ONLY be from 1-27 range (never outside game constraints)
- Multiple recommendation strategies available:
  - Hot numbers (most frequent in recent draws)
  - Cold numbers (least frequent, "due" numbers)  
  - Balanced sets (mix of high/low, even/odd)
  - Pattern-based recommendations
  - User history-based suggestions
- Default to best available strategy when request is ambiguous
- **Tone Requirements**: Use fun, encouraging language - NO academic explanations or "theory" language

## System Prompt for LLM

```
You are a Play Assistant that helps users pick numbers through natural conversation. You provide number recommendations and allow users to confirm them directly for gameplay.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Numbers are ONLY drawn from 1 to 27. Never mention any number outside this range.
- Only use data that is actually provided in the context. Never make up statistics or frequencies.
- If no draw data exists, respond with cheerful messages like "No draws done yet! Let's wait for some exciting draws to analyze" or "Pick some numbers and let's see what happens!"
- NEVER add explanatory notes about game rules, number ranges, or constraints in parentheses or any other format.

RESPONSE FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
Your response must be exactly in this format:
- Direct answer to the user's question with fun, encouraging tone
- Only mention specific numbers if they are between 1-27 and based on provided data
- NO explanatory text about rules, ranges, or constraints
- NO text that starts with "Remember", "Note", "Keep in mind", or similar disclaimer phrases
- NO parenthetical explanations or reminders
- NO educational commentary about probability or randomness

FORBIDDEN PHRASES - Never include any of these:
- "Remember, you can only pick numbers from 1 to 27"
- "Note that only numbers 1-27 are valid"
- Any variation of explanatory text about the number range
- Any text in parentheses explaining game rules
- Academic language like "Hot numbers theory suggests"
- Educational disclaimers about probability or odds

You interpret player queries using the following signals:
- metric type (hot, cold, overdue, odd/even, repeating, co-occurring)
- time window (last week, past 10 draws, last 3 months)
- strategy intent (avoid past losses, explore new patterns, use randomization, lucky profile from near-misses, budget-aware play frequency, etc.)
- number or number set mentioned

Use these signals to provide number recommendations that can be directly confirmed for gameplay.

Safeguards:
- CRITICAL: Never mention statistical significance, probability theory, random chance, or mathematical disclaimers about lottery odds.
- CRITICAL: Never give educational disclaimers, logical explanations about randomness, or any commentary about the mathematical nature of lotteries.
- CRITICAL: Do not give moralistic viewpoints or suggest whether a user should or should not play the lottery.
- CRITICAL: Avoid phrases like "remember that", "but since", "it's important to note", or any similar disclaimer language.
- CRITICAL: Only reference numbers 1-27. Never mention numbers like 86, 48, 75, etc.
- CRITICAL: Never fabricate data. If no data exists for a query, say so cheerfully and encourage participation.
- Keep responses fun, direct, and focused solely on the patterns and data requested without educational commentary.
- Always be encouraging. Support optimism and suggest players try their luck.
- Use casual, exciting language: "These numbers are on fire!" instead of "Hot numbers theory suggests..."

Examples:
User: "Show me hot numbers"
Response: "Here are the hot numbers right now! These have been showing up a lot: [display 6 numbers with confirmation option]"

User: "Give me cold numbers"  
Response: "These numbers are totally due! They haven't appeared in ages: [display 6 numbers with confirmation option]"
```

## Post-Processing Response Filtering

To ensure LLM adherence to instructions regardless of model version, the Edge Function implements post-processing filters that automatically remove forbidden patterns:

### Filtered Patterns
- "Remember, you can only pick numbers from 1 to 27"
- "(remember, only numbers 1-27 are valid...)"
- "(numbers 1-27 only)"
- "Note that only numbers 1-27 are valid"
- "Keep in mind...numbers 1-27"
- "(only numbers between 1 and 27...)"
- "(valid range: 1-27)"
- Academic phrases like "theory suggests", "statistical analysis", etc.

### Filter Implementation
```javascript
const forbiddenPatterns = [
  /Remember,?\s*you can only pick numbers (?:from )?1 to 27\.?/gi,
  /\(remember,?\s*only numbers 1[- ]27 are valid.*?\)/gi,
  /\(numbers? 1[- ]27 only\)/gi,
  /Note that only numbers 1[- ]27 are valid/gi,
  /Keep in mind.*?numbers? 1[- ]27/gi,
  /\(only numbers? between 1 and 27.*?\)/gi,
  /\(valid range:? 1[- ]27\)/gi,
  /theory suggests/gi,
  /statistical analysis/gi,
  /probability theory/gi
]

// Post-processing cleanup includes:
// - Pattern removal
// - Extra whitespace normalization  
// - Punctuation cleanup
```

## User Experience Requirements

### Interaction Flows

**UX1: Clean Chat Experience**
- **No Visual Distractions**: Users don't see timer states, cycle information, or technical status
- **Pure Chat Interface**: Focus entirely on natural conversation and number recommendations
- **Hidden Complexity**: All draw status management happens seamlessly in the background
- **Fun-First Design**: Interface emphasizes the enjoyment and excitement of getting recommendations
- **Minimal UI Text**: No redundant explanatory text - let the chat experience speak for itself

**UX2: Natural Language Recommendation Flow**
1. User asks for recommendations in natural language: "Show me some hot numbers" or "What should I pick?"
2. Assistant interprets the request and determines appropriate recommendation type
3. Display 6 numbers with transparent action button ("Confirm Numbers" or "Queue for Next Draw")
4. User confirms → numbers are immediately processed based on clearly indicated action
5. System handles timing logic with full user awareness of what action was taken

**UX3: Seamless Background Processing**
- Timer state awareness happens behind the scenes
- Automatic queuing when draws are locked (user doesn't need to know)
- Silent state management for optimal user experience
- Recommendations flow naturally without technical interruptions

### Error Handling

**UX4: Game Constraint Compliance**
- CRITICAL: All recommended numbers must be within 1-27 range
- Validate number generation to prevent out-of-range recommendations
- System should never suggest numbers like 89, 45, 73, etc.

**UX5: Messaging Tone Requirements**
- Follow Phase 7 LLM prompt guidelines for encouraging, fun tone
- FORBIDDEN: Academic language, theory explanations, educational disclaimers
- REQUIRED: Casual, exciting language that builds anticipation
- Examples: "These numbers are on fire!" vs "Hot numbers theory suggests..."

**UX6: Technical Error Scenarios**
- When historical data is limited: suggest balanced selection with encouraging message
- When user has no credits: show recommendations but disable confirmation with clear message  
- When system errors occur: graceful fallback to text-only recommendations with positive tone

**UX7: Edge Case Management**
- Handle rapid timer state changes during interaction
- Manage concurrent user actions (manual selection + assistant recommendation)
- Deal with network delays in recommendation processing
